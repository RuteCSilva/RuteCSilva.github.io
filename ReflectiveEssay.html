							<h1>Reflective Essay</h1>
							<p>Machine learning (ML) algorithms are powerful tools that have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and transformed the way businesses and organizations operate (Renganathan, 2021; Roh et al., 2021). As part of my learning journey through this module, I have gained extensive knowledge of the applicability and challenges of various ML algorithms while being prompted to reflect on legal, social, ethical, and professional issues associated with ML, and challenged to work collaboratively to develop core soft skills. </p>
							<p>In this reflective essay, I will examine my understanding of these algorithms, my individual contributions and experiences to team activities, and the impact that this knowledge and experience have had on my professional and personal development. By exploring these areas, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of the role of ML in the industry and how it can be used to improve organizational performance and drive innovation.</p>
							<p>Throughout this module, while completing my <a href=3Activities.html>E-porfolio activities</a> or completing my <a href="4Seminars.html">seminar pre-work</a>, I have created schemas to summarise the ML algorithms covered through the module. Some of the key considerations about the “legal, social, ethical, and professional issues machine learning professionals face” are not specific to ML and can be generalised through AI and this made me revise my notes from Module 1 (Understanding Artificial Intelligence) and reinforced the have significant challenges ML professionals face to make sure the technology is deployed in a transparent, fair, sustainable and accountable way, as the FAST principles state (Leslie, 2019) so it is not surprising, the algorithms covered in this module need particular attention to ensure personal information is used appropriately, do not discriminate or induce bias, are validated and interpreted and communicated correctly in line with the principles stated above.</p>
							<p>The applicability of different datasets for ML algorithms in particular or performing EDA effectively depends on the nature of the problem being addressed and the characteristics of the data (Bonaccorso, 2020; Patil, 2018) and although I found it interesting working with AirBnB data for one of our projects, the limitations of not being completely familiar with the business and the data were very visible in the final result as our insights did not provide the necessary clarity into the business and the interpretation of the outputs we did manage to produce also lacked in-depth discussion as per the feedback we got.</p>
							<p>Nonetheless, the opportunity to work collaboratively is always a great accelerator of learning and as Kukeska et al. (2020) suggest, a model of education prioritising experiential learning interdisciplinary studies, and the use of technology to enhance the learning experience will better prepare the student to the new technologies and changing workforce demands. During this module, both through <a href="1Discussion.html">forum discussion</a> and <a href="2Group_Work.html">group work</a>, I was given the opportunity to develop my technical skills with my peer’s support while bringing to the group my mathematical background, in particular, my understanding of statistics. It was transformative to discuss in a virtual environment, both synchronously and asynchronously, managing 3 different time zones at a given time, but to illustrate how our strengths made us better, as we were struggling to increase the correlation between the variables our theoretical background suggested, I suggested applying a logarithmic transformation aiming to get a normal distribution (Field, 2013) and, by myself, I would have had to find an appropriate Python library and the code to do a simple log transformation, but, building on my peer’s technical strengths the process was a lot simpler even though the outcome for my learning journey just as efficient. </p>
							<p>Becoming proficient with Python is still my personal goal and although this module has provided the foundation, I needed to keep working to achieve it, the second group task was more challenging. I understand the processes and reinforcing a learning model focused on interdisciplinary fields of knowledge (Kukeska et al. 2020), I found interesting all the parallels between Neural Networks and the human brain, how the mathematical processes support these Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) become more than just applied statistics as they use activation functions, for example, which is responsible for introducing non-linearity to the output of a neuron: a key feature of the behaviour of biological neurons in the brain (Sharma et al., 2020). It was interesting to have a background both in Geophysics and Psychology, but I need to develop my knowledge of NNs to fully integrate my interdisciplinary knowledge. For example, having a background in Geophysics, I wonder if there is something to learn from how waves behave travelling in different materials and if this is something we can explore both in human and artificial neural networks.</p>
							<p>In essence, the structure of this module did foster my professional and personal growth. Having to produce a portfolio reminded me of the importance of metadata and data dictionaries to achieve the best results with data analysis, which led me to build a library of <a href="5Readings.html"> reading summaries</a> – something I had stopped doing since my first undergrad degree – and this, alongside with the other portfolio activities enable more meaningful connections through the module content. </p>
