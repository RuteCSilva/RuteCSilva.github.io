							<h1>Group Work</h1>
							<h2>Assignment 1 * Unit 6 * Focus on EDA </h2>
							<p>In this project, my role was primarily focused on researching and compiling the introduction and supporting the team with theoretical background throughout the project. Additionally, I led discussions and provided support as needed, while another team member completed the exploratory data analysis (EDA) synchronously on Zoom.</p>
							<p>As an academic, I understand the importance of building a strong theoretical foundation for any research project. My contribution of reading materials for the introduction allowed the team to establish a solid foundation and clearly define the scope of the project. This ensured that we were able to set clear research objectives and work towards achieving them efficiently.</p>
							<p>Furthermore, my ability to provide theoretical support throughout the project allowed us to deepen our understanding of the concepts and methodologies being used. This helped the team to critically evaluate the results of the EDA analysis and ensure that they were accurately interpreted.</p>
							<p>Working synchronously on Zoom allowed for real-time collaboration and immediate feedback, which is essential in any academic project. While the other team member focused on completing the EDA analysis, my theoretical background support helped to ensure that the analysis was grounded in sound theoretical principles. Working as team, building on each otherâ€™s strengths, allowed us to grow both theoretical and technical skills.</p>
							<p>In conclusion, my contribution to this project was vital in building a strong theoretical foundation and ensuring that the analysis was grounded in sound theoretical principles. My ability to lead discussions and provide support as needed allowed us to work efficiently and achieve our research objectives effectively. Working synchronously on Zoom allowed for real-time collaboration and immediate feedback, which are crucial elements of academic teamwork. Overall, this project was a successful example of effective academic collaboration.</p>
						
							<h2>Assignment 2 * Unit 11 * Focus on CNN </h2>
							<p>Teamwork is an essential aspect of most projects, and in my opinion, it is one of the most efficient ways to achieve the desired outcome. In this project, I played a crucial role by contributing to the theoretical foundation with reading materials and then creating the presentation structure and design. These may seem like small contributions, but they are important in providing a solid foundation for the rest of the team to build upon.</p>
							<p>Alberto, having a strong background in coding, completed the Neural Network Models for Object Recognition, which is a complex and challenging task. However, I was still involved in the process by meeting with the team on Zoom to discuss how to improve the model and debug the code aiming to implement what was being taught through the seminars. This was a great source of professional growth.</p>
							<p>Overall, I believe that this project highlights the importance of teamwork and collaboration. Each member of the team has a unique set of skills and knowledge, and by working together, you can achieve something that would have been impossible to accomplish individually. It is also essential to recognize that every contribution, no matter how small, plays a crucial role in the success of the project.</p>
