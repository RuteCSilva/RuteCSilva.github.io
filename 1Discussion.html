							<h1>Collaborative Discussion</h1>
							<h2>1. The 4th Industrial Revolution</h2>
							<p><b>Prompt:</b> Read the Schwab (2016) article from World Economic Forum and discuss the impact of Industry 4.0 on the sector in which you are involved or interested.</p>
							<p><b>Reading Summary:</b> The article by Klaus Schwab published in the World Economic Forum in 2016 is titled "The Fourth Industrial Revolution: What It Means, How to Respond." The article discusses the impact of the fourth industrial revolution on various aspects of society, including education, healthcare, and politics. It highlights how the fourth industrial revolution is characterized by a fusion of technologies that are blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres. The article emphasizes the need for individuals and organizations to adapt to this new era of rapid technological change, and to focus on creating a human-centred approach to technological innovation. The author suggests that this approach should prioritize the development of new skills and the cultivation of human values, such as empathy and creativity, to build a sustainable and equitable future for all.</p>
							<p><b>My contribution:</b> I choose education as the focus sector and the discussion revolves around the issue of children missing education in the UK and the potential use of biometric data to identify them. While some people believe that using unique identifiers like the NHS number could help solve the problem, others are concerned about increasing child data surveillance. The use of biometric data to identify missing children could be a viable solution, but it also raises questions about data privacy. Furthermore, the discussion brings up the example of Mexico, where the government's attempt to collect biometric data to access a SIM card raised significant privacy concerns. The participants agree that finding the right balance between using technology to solve real-world problems and protecting people's privacy is crucial.</p>

							<h2>2. Legal and Ethical views on ANN application</h2>
							<p><b>Prompt:</b>Read/listen to the article by Hutson (2021) in Nature on Robo-writers. This week, post your thoughts on the risks and benefits of the use AI writers at different levels, from administrative work to creative writing.</p>
							<p><b>Reading Summary:</b>Hutson's (2021) article in Nature discusses the advancements in the field of natural language generation (NLG) and the growing use of robo-writers. The article highlights the increasing capability of these systems to produce high-quality content that is almost indistinguishable from that written by human authors. However, the author also raises concerns about the ethical implications of using these systems, such as the potential for deception, and the impact on the job market for writers and journalists. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of developing clear guidelines and ethical frameworks for the use of robo-writers in order to ensure that these systems are used in a responsible and transparent manner.</p>
							<p><b>My contribution:</b>According to Hutson's (2021) article in Nature on robo-writers one of the benefits of using AI writers in administrative work is that it can save time. AI can also generate standard responses, however, relying too heavily on AI-generated responses may result in a lack of personalization and empathy in customer interactions.</p>
							<p>Interestingly, earlier this year, I decided to test GPT-3 for this purpose. I had received an email from a client cancelling a meeting due to personal circumstances. My prompt to ChatGPT was “email from a student saying he might not make it to the meeting because her little boy needs to go to a walk-in to check if he broke his toe. How do I reply empathetically” and, almost instantly, the platform replied:</p>
								<blockquote><p>Dear [Student],
								<p>Thank you for letting me know about your situation. I'm sorry to hear that your little boy might have broken his toe, and I hope he is feeling okay. Please don't worry about missing the meeting - your family's health and well-being come first.
								<p>Let me know if there's anything I can do to help, and we can reschedule the meeting if necessary. Take care and I hope everything goes well at the walk-in.
								<p>Best regards,
								<p></p>[Your Name]
								</blockquote>
							<p>Which is a decent reply with a degree of empathy. 
							<p>In conclusion, while AI writers can provide significant benefits in terms of time and cost savings, personalization, and even creativity, it is essential to approach their use with caution and critical thinking. AI should be viewed as a complement, rather than a replacement, to human writing to ensure the highest quality of written content. 
							</p>
							<p><b>Other thoughts by Alberto:</b> Hutson's (2021) also explores the advantages of AI writers in journalism and creative writing. In journalism, for example, AI writers can quickly generate news stories from raw data, freeing up reporters' time to focus on more in-depth reporting. AI can also personalize content for individual readers, which can improve engagement and retention. However, AI-generated content may lack the nuance and context that human journalists can provide, leading to inaccuracies or biased reporting.</p>
							<p>Trying out this function on ChatGPT, I copied a headline from google news and asked it to generate a short story. Here is the result:</p>
								<blockquote><p><b>Prompt:</b>
									Report on the following news “Nurses' strikes could continue till Christmas, warns RCN union leader.”
									<p><b>Result:</b>“According to the news, the leader of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) union has warned that nurses' strikes could continue until Christmas. The strike action is in response to the ongoing pay dispute between the government and healthcare workers in the UK.
										The RCN union leader's warning comes after a recent vote by members of the union to reject the government's proposed 1% pay raise for NHS workers. Nurses and other healthcare workers have been on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic for over a year, and many feel that the proposed pay rise does not adequately recognize their sacrifices and contributions.
										The potential continuation of the strikes until Christmas would represent a significant challenge for the NHS, which is already facing staffing shortages and increased pressure due to the pandemic. It would also have a significant impact on patients and their families, who rely on the care provided by nurses and other healthcare workers.
										The RCN union leader's warning underscores the growing frustration and dissatisfaction among healthcare workers in the UK, who feel undervalued and underpaid. It remains to be seen whether the government will respond to these concerns and make a new offer that is more acceptable to the union and its members.”
									</blockquote></p>
							<p>After reading the news report Adams (2023) report, the inconsistencies are clear being the most blatant discrepancy the percentage of the raise being demanded: 1% according to ChatGPT and 5% according to Adams(2023). </p>		
							</p><p>Overall, AI writers in journalism should be approached with caution and critical thinking. While it can provide significant benefits, it should be viewed as a complement, rather than a replacement, to human journalism. AI algorithms should be monitored for accuracy and bias, and human journalists should be involved in the content generation process to ensure the highest quality of reporting. </p>
							<p><b>Final thoughts</b> As Yejin Choi cited by Hutson's (2021) refers to GPT- 3 as “essentially a mouth without a brain” which begs the question of why it feels so plausible when we read an answer provided by the technology. It reminds me of <a href="ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S0FDjFBj8o">Will Stephen’s TEDx Talk</a> about sounding smart using strategies to engage the audience. In essence, AI writers, seem to be able to use language structures to retrieve a reasonably coherent message without it being necessarily accurate or giving any insights.</p>
							<p>In summary, AI writers can be a good tool to unblock writing, a quick reply and address frequently asked questions but the risks of using AI writers across all levels include the potential for biased or inaccurate content, as AI algorithms can perpetuate existing biases or misunderstand data inputs.</p>
