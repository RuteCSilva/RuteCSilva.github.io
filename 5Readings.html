							</p>
							<blockquote>Vaio et al. (2020) conducted a systematic literature review to explore the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), business models, and sustainable development goals (SDGs). They found that AI can be leveraged to enable sustainable business models that promote the SDGs, such as reducing waste and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the authors also noted that AI can exacerbate existing inequalities and contribute to unethical business practices if not properly regulated. They suggest that policymakers and businesses should prioritize a human-centric approach to AI development and implementation, while also considering the potential impacts on the environment and society.
							</blockquote>
							<blockquote>The study conducted by Vaio et al. (2020) did not specifically focus on artificial neural networks (ANNs), but rather on the broader concept of artificial intelligence (AI). ANNs are a type of machine learning algorithm that is used in AI, but the authors did not delve into the technical details of different AI techniques or algorithms. Instead, they examined the role of AI more broadly in enabling sustainable business models that promote the SDGs. However, it is worth noting that ANNs can be used in various applications related to sustainability, such as predicting energy consumption or optimizing resource allocation, which can contribute to the achievement of the SDGs.
